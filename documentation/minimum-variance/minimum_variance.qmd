# Overview

The minimum variance portfolio estimates the variance-covariance matrix using a factor model approach similar to MSCI Barra and constructs the portfolio that minimizes variance. Returns are assumed to follow a linear factor model, where security characteristics serve as observable factor loadings and latent factor returns are inferred from cross-sectional regressions.

# Variance-Covariance Estimation

## Factor Model

To estimate the variance-covariance matrix, we use an approach similar to the one used by MSCI Barra, which is based on the assumption that returns follow a linear factor model. The idea is to treat security characteristics as observable factor loadings and infer the latent factor returns from cross-sectional regressions of excess returns on security characteristics. Specifically, each day we estimate the cross-sectional regression:
$$
r_{i,t+1} = x'_{i,t}\hat{f}_{t+1} + \hat{\epsilon}_{i,t+1},
$$ {#eq-barra-reg}
where $r_{i,t+1}$ is the stock's realized excess return, $x$ is a vector of the stock's characteristics, $\hat{\epsilon}_{i,t+1}$ is the regression residual, and $\hat{f}_{t+1}$ is the estimated regression parameters, which we treat as estimated factor returns. The stock characteristics are the 402 `features` and 12 industry dummies based on SIC codes and the industry definition from Kenneth French's webpage.^[Our approach differs from @jensen2025machine, who use a compressed version of 13 factor themes (made from the original 153 JKP characteristics) plus the 12 industry dummies. We use the raw characteristics to enable the variance-covariance estimate to change as we change the set of characteristics. The Sharpe ratio is higher if we use the 13 factor themes instead of the 402 raw characteristics.]

The structure in @eq-barra-reg implies that the variance-covariance matrix is:
$$
\hat{\Sigma}_t = X_t\text{Var}_t(\hat{f}_{t+1}) X'_t + \text{diag}(\text{Var}_t(\hat{\epsilon}_{t+1})),
$$
where $X_t$ is the matrix of stock characteristics, $\text{Var}(\hat{f}_{t+1})$ is the variance-covariance matrix of factor returns, and $\text{diag}(\text{Var}(\epsilon_{t+1}))$ is a matrix with the idiosyncratic variances in the diagonal and zero elsewhere.

## Factor Return Covariance

We estimate $\text{Var}(\hat{f}_{t+1})$ as the exponentially weighted sample variance-covariance matrix of the last ten years of daily returns. The exponential weighting scheme gives observations $j$ days from $t$ a weight of $w_{t-j}=c \cdot 0.5^{j/\text{half-life}}$, where $c$ is a constant ensuring that the weights sum to one, and it ensures that recent observations affect the estimate more than distant ones. Following the MSCI Barra USE4S model, we use a half-life of 504 days for correlations and 84 days for variances [@menchero2011barra, Table 4.1].

## Idiosyncratic Variance

Similarly, we estimate each stock's idiosyncratic variance, $\text{Var}_t(\hat{\epsilon}_{i,t+1})$, as the exponentially weighted moving average of squared residuals, $\hat{\epsilon}_{i,t+1}$ from @eq-barra-reg, with a half-life of 84 days. The half-life is again chosen as the one from the MSCI Barra USE4S model [@menchero2011barra, Table 5.1]. To estimate the idiosyncratic variance we require at least 200 non-missing observations within the last 252 trading days. For stocks without an idiosyncratic variance estimate, we estimate the function, $\ln\left({\sqrt{\hat{\text{Var}}_t(\hat{\epsilon}_{i,t+1})}}\right)=\hat{f}_t(x_{i,t})$, using a ridge regression model with a small ridge penalty of $10^{-4}$, and use it to estimate the missing variances.^[Our approach follows MSCI Barra [@menchero2011barra, Eq. 5.3], except that they use an OLS regression. We use a ridge regression because some of our characteristics are highly correlated, and using a small penalty helps make the estimates robust to near multicollinearity.]
