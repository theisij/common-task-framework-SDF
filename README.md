## Overview
Here's what I (Theis) suggest we do when constructing a new model:
1. Save script in separate folder under 'models_python' if it's a python model, or under 'models_R' if it's an R model, and the main function that we upload to the competition website should have have meaningfull name. For example, I saved the 1/N model as 'models_python/one_over_n/one_over_n.py'
2. Save the csv output in a separate folder under 'data/processed' with a meaningfull name. For example, I saved the 1/N model as 'data/processed/one_over_n/one_over_n.csv'
3. Save the documentation in a separate folder under 'documentation' with a meaningfull name. For example, I saved the 1/N model as 'documentation/one_over_n/one_over_n.pdf'
